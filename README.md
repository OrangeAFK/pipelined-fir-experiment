# pipelined-fir-experiment
## About
  This project of the week implements and simulates a FIR filter in Vivado HDL. The main objectives include:
  - A baseline FIR filter implementation
  - Pipelining for higher clock speeds
  - Fixed-point scaling and overflow handling
  - Benchmarking these three models to compare resource usage and latency.
